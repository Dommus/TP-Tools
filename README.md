**Current Features:**
Grid Scale - You can use the shortcuts plus (+) and minus (-) on the numpad to increase or decrease the grid scale. Edit the Python file to change them to your preference.

Create Cubes - "Draw Cube" to activate the Add Cube tool / "Create 1x1 Cube" to create an 1x1 Cube with its bottom face on top of the grid.

**Installation:**
You can try using Blender's addon install dropdowns, or simply drop the folder inside the .../scripts/addons folder (probably in AppData).

The grid system I'm currently using has: the *Unit System* set to "None"; In *Viewport Overlays* set "Subdivisions" to 1; The Add Cube's tool settings to *Depth:* Surface, *Orientation:* Default, *Snap to:* Default.

**Disclaimer:**
**VERY JANKY** as I made it quickly as a personal QOL tool. Might have some bugs or play badly with some versions of Blender. Only tested on 4.1 and 4.2.
